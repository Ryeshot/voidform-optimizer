    can mean in the future.\
    \n\n\
    Ramp, by my self-proclaimed definition, is a damage pattern where you start at a weaker state, end at your strongest state, \
    and there is some transition of the strength of your state over time."

    existence, and for the sake of it and Shadow I pray we do not experience ramp in this form again.\
    \n\n\
    Borrowed power, in the form of Mass Hysteria in Legion and Chorus of Insanity/Spiteful Apparitions in Battle for Azeroth, \
    has created unhealthy ramp patterns for spec. In Legion, because of how the benefits of borrowed power compound with the \
    benefits of Voidform, Voidform stacks had significantly more power budget at the latest-most part of it. For this reason, \
    leaving Voidform early, by any means, lead to excessive punishment on the player. In Battle for Azeroth, Voidform stacks \
    had even more backloaded power because you needed to end Voidform in order to receive the benefit. So either you get too few stacks \
    from Voidform and leave early, or you leave at the right time and are unable to benefit from the stacks you attained (due to not being \
    able to attack a target and maintain Voidform). Not only did both of these cause excessive punishment to the player, but the performance \
    of a Voidform was dependent on the performance of the previous Voidform, due to benefits from Voidform lasting quite a long ways into the \
    next one. A term which I coin \"Voidform dependency\", and I believe this to be unhealthy for the spec to have.\
    \n\n\
    Lingering Insanity is also a major offender when it comes to ramp. Due to its implementation, except for 7.0 in Legion, Lingering \
    Insanity had lasting effects into the next Voidform, which means you were first at your most powerful the second Voidform of any \
    encounter. Lingering Insanity also adds more dependency to Voidform stacks, which means failing to attain stacks, or failing to \
    act while Lingering Insanity stacks are active, leads to excessive punishment."

{
    header: "Ideal Ramp",
    content: "Now that we have established the pitfalls of past ramp designs, let us now explore how to correct those pitfalls into \
    an ideal ramp pattern.\
    \n\n\
    First I need to define what I mean when I say \"excessive punishment\". In my mind, excessive punishment is when the player is \
    unfairly punishment for failing, for whatever reason, to achieve a goal. In the case of Voidform, that goal is Voidform, and \
    therefore the punishment should be losing Voidform. Any other negative effects I would deem as excessive punishment.\
    \n\n\
    So how do we correct excessive punishment? That's simple - do not let it exist. The punishment for falling out of Voidform should \
    be, and should only be, losing Voidform. This is one reason Lingering Insanity was removed from my Shadowlands design.\
    \n\n\
    Correcting Voidform dependency is another easy one. If there exist any rewards after ending a Voidform, do not let them influence \
    the next Voidform. In my Shadowlands design the only reward I have included baseline is Devouring Plague, should one use it in while \
    in Voidform. Used this way, Devouring Plague's quick Insanity generation lends to reaching the next Voidform faster while preventing \
    it from influencing the performance of the next Voidform.\
    \n\n\
    Now let's discuss about how to balance this ideal ramp damage pattern. Again it's relatively simple, let us make the weakest state \
    not too weak, and the strongest state not too strong. Going into Shadowform from Voidform should give you a damage increase, but \
    not enough of a damage increase make damage in Shadowform feel like nothing. And now that the ramp of Voidform is mostly in Shadowform, \
    we can reach a pretty strong state rather quickly. While stacking haste might not be a compelling reason to extend Voidform for long \
    purely for damage, the quickening pace of the rotation from that stacking haste is."
